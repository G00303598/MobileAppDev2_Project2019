This application is designed for UWP and Android.

This is a calorie and general health tracking application which
utilises JSON storage locally to the device and displays all of
the previous entries the user has inputted. 
It has complete CRUD functionality and 
also camera functionality (both video and photo functionality
are in the code but only camera is used due to issues displaying videos).
It also displays the title "My Health Tracker" on both devices (UWP, Android).

To view more about this application please view the Wiki Part of this repository.
